will be freezed.

People will test the building of the ZIP, and if it works and compiles for 
all, the rc ZIP will be released as final. If it miscompiles, a small patch 
will be commited, and a new ZIP will be created, and we will continue until 
the ZIP works for everybody. 

When we decide that the RC ZIP is going to final, new screen shots will be 
uploaded to the SVN copy of the site, and to the berlios admin page, and only 
when all people like the changes, the site will be uploaded, and a new tag 
will be created on the SVN.

When 0.2.3 will be released, we will start debating about how to start the 
development on 0.3.x. Meanwhile, we need to release something, what is on SVN 
trunk will be it.

/me is fixing compilation warnings and GUI oopses on trunk.
