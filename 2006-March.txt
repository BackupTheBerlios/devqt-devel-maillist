Hello guys!
First of all sorry to not be on the IRC meeting.

Now, lets talk about the development:

First I agree with Cesar, we really need a Roadmap, so it is my opinion that
every thing coded until now is just a prototype, nothing more!

Well, that I would like to know every one here, please could you reply this
with your name, age, country, city, formation and Qt experience?
Let me start:

Name: Thiago Alves [Townk]
Age: 27
Country: Brazil (-3:00 GMT)
City: Curitiba
Formation: Computer Scientist and Master in Distributed Systems
Qt experience: about 5 years (since Qt2)

Hi,

I don't think that just throwing all the code that has been written is a good 
idea, as we can reuse some of it. 

Regarding a road map, I say in the next month release whats on SVN trunk as 
0.2.3, and then decide where we can go to 0.3.0.

I am reading KDE's code since 3.0.0, and I am quite n00b with Qt to be 
honest :)

Hi!
Name: Ovidiu Sabou
Age: 19
Country: Romania (GMT +2)
Formation: Computer Science student
Qt experience: very little; i've written a small program with qt2:
http://repchat.sf.net

How I got interested in this project: I wanted an IDE with Qt integration.
Eclipse is very good for C++ but it doesn't provide Qt support. I've seen
this project on QtCentre and though why not contribute... I don't care if I
use an IDE made with Qt or Java or whatever what I want it is to do the job.
Since you want to do this in Qt from scratch I though it may be a good time
for some contribution :) (although I don't have Qt experience I can adapt
quickly)

I've attached a small design document about what I'd like to have in an IDE.

Yes, a roadmap and good planning is needed. I am happy that Thiago Santos
has Qt experience; it is a good sign :)
We talked on IRC about starting DevQt with the interface and the core of the
IDE .. this means no integration with any tools, just the basic interface
with configuration system, a basic editor, the plugin system and the build
system for the IDE itself(the program should build on every platform that Qt
builds). Thiago offered to write the UI system. What do you think about this
?

Another question that I have is about the Qt trademark. I am not sure if
DevQt is a safe name; Trolltech may not be very happy about this. Maybe DevQ
would be a better name ?

The current trunk crashes on me while I try and close the application.

Hi,

I scheduling a release for 1-4-2006. The release cycle is as follows:

Until 1-4-2006, the SVN will recive only  bug fixes. No new features.

I have just checked a clean copy, and made I can reconfirm this.

bool DevWorkSpace::closeProject(const QString& name)
deletion(*p);
cb->removeItem( index );

The problem itself is in file devworkspace.cpp, line 449. The problem is that 
index equals -1, which means no indexes have been found.

The way to reproduce is to execute the application, and without opening a main 
project, closing the main window. The fix has been comited to the SVN.

Hi,

I agree with the new release policy. There are a few bug fixes to do in 
highlighting, I'll try to get rid of them and I may commit the current 
version of project management part.

If you want to add the new project management  part, do this today or 
tomorrow. We will get stucked on QA problems, and I want to tackle them 
as fast as possible.


Meanwhile, the project coredumps on win32, mingw4. This is way more 
important then a new feature.

Hi all,

I have updates the source in tools/qmdilib. Now most of the source should be 
documented, and hopefully this documents will help people understand how to 
use the APIs. Please comment on that.

The new code ships with much usable APIs, while still exporting low level 
APIs. The code for qmdiTabWidget is now much smaller, and much more readable. 

I will see what can be done on the flickering of the toolbars. It flickers a 
lot on X11, and on Win32 it's even worst. I also need to define merge points 
(see where the same command is on "File" menus). 

Thiago, I am still waiting to see your magic, you did not commit it yet

:)

?This means that your code will be added for 0.3.x.

I will make a ZIP tomorrow, and we will start the testing of 0.2.2. 

Meanwhile,
Can anyone fix the bug with the goto line? Just choose gotoline from the menu, 
and you will see the dialog twice.

Please don't commit anything to the trunk, unless someone else reviewed your 
code, please write in the commit log who reviewed your code, otherwise I will 
just unapply the patch.

Is anyone having building problems with trunk? please recheck it and compiled 
it. It should work on the first try.

Good night

Message-ID: <200603292212.47513.elcuco@kde.org>

Hi,

I am not calling this beta, since quite frankly it's crap ware. We were not 
able to code something usefull until now, that's simply the truth. Lets 
release this, and start over again.

The current code, compiles and runs on 
* XP MingW 4, Qt 4.1.0/4.1.1
* Open SuSE  10.0 Qt rsync from this weekend

I need more input about where it compiles and runs. 

TODO:
The about box is empty
The goto line dialog is opened twise if you choose the menu command
Toolbars are badly organized
On compilation the compilation tab is not showed
The status bar jumps too much (text changes size way too much)
No keyboard shortcuts to move between tabs.
Too many useless commands on the menus and dialogs

Not working (not for this version):
Openning new projects
Search in project
Replace in project
Project properties
Debugger
Profiler
Sane editor
etc...


I will generate test2 this Friday, in hope that people will commit code to fix 
those problems into the SVN. The list in the TODO shuold be cleared. If I 
don't see cooperation, I will start V 0.3.x on trunk without releasing this 
code. 

The zip is available here:
http://devqt.berlios.de/tmp/devqt-0.2.2-1.zip.txt

Just rename it, and post how here how the compilation worked for you.

Wake up team!
