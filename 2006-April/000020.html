<PRE>Hi Florian,

We are about to release V 0.2.2, this is whats found on the trunk ATM.
The release is scheduled for 10 of April. 

We are not sure what will happen with this release, as I started
founding a lot of crahses under Ubuntu Dapper. It worked for me fine on
XP and SuSE, and for FMC under WinME, but for Thiago it crashes as well
under XP (no more info about were does it fail).

Thiago and me where thinking about making a new modular system for the
branch 0.3.x, but I am not sure how to handle it ATM. I Will probably
start developing in some branch and let the rest of the team work on
trunk. 

I may suggest to start getting the whole SVN and telling us if trunk
works for you. It should compile for you without any oopses, and run
smoothly. Next week we will debate about how to continue the
development. 

Reguarding patches, just put the on the berios site, or mail them, to
any of the devlopers. We will make good use of them.
