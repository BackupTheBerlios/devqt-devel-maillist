</I>Please watch your language.

Yes, this mailing list has a policy of 40kb or less attachments. Mailing 
lists are not for download. Bounces are send to a mail of mine I do not 
check ofter, that is why I did not notice it. If you want, I can forward 
the mail to the list.

In future, please don't do releases as posts on forums or mailing lists. 
There are more traditional ways of doing this kind of things.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> check out :

</I>I assume you do not want community helping you with this project. 
Otherwise, you would announce that you are about to release a new beta, 
and what are your goals for that beta. People would then check your code 
and help you debug it.

At least upload your source to the SVN, and hopefully  in a same matter, 
in small increments so we can understand what are you changing in the code.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or, for a direct download :

</I>&gt;<i> P.S : I talked about qmdilib toolbar system in my previous mail but it 
</I>&gt;<i> actually looks like I'll have to mix my architecture with elcuco's one 
</I>&gt;<i> to get something both flexible and able to keep toolbars location ( + 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to make it the less flicky I can)
</I>The toolbars keep location bewteen context changes, at least no my box. 
The flickers, I konw, I will see how can I take care of it. Not a high 
priority at the moment.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here it is! Not finished yet but it compiles, runs and looks fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's still a lot of work to do, especially for the default plugin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'd rather fully implement the base and make sure it's bug free 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before going further.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have a look, test it and give me feedback. The most important things 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want to know :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - does it compiles on your PC ?
</I>Yes.
&gt;&gt;<i> - does it runs fine on your PC ?
</I>Yes. XP QT 4.1.1 MinGW 4.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> @Elcuco : I tested your plugin demo and there are interesting stuff 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but you were right : the code is a mess !!!
</I>Can you comment more briefly what &quot;is a mess&quot;? I understood that you 
modified the code, but the changes are lost in the complexity of the 
program. I just don't see them.

The code of the &quot;demos&quot; is still not finished, that is why it might be 
partly problematic. This is why I did not announce it as public beta. 
It's still been developed.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S : you may notice that I rewrote lots of things in qmdilib : 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client - server connection works better, toolbars update is less 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flicky and toolbars are now much more flexible (widgets and toolbar 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breaks are allowed)
</I>Can you describe how much flexible your code is? How is it done?
I don't want to be picky, but according to GPL (yes, my library is LGPL, 
but similar rules apply here) you are supposed to describe the changes 
to each file at the top. It's used to use some VCS to maintain those 
things. You are not doing any of them.

Quite frankly, I dont care about the license issue. But, if you want to 
make my life easier in helping you, please document the changes, and ask 
for new features. in qmdilib. I am thinking about new functionalities I 
want to add  to the lib, and if you don't talk, you will find your code 
going in another direction then mine. This is called a fork.
