<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i>In future, please don't do releases as posts on forums or mailing lists. 
</I>&gt;<i>There are more traditional ways of doing this kind of things.
</I>
on which forum??? Berlios developpment forum does not support attachement 
AFAIK and I wouldn't like to use QtCentre to post such an experimental 
thing.


&gt;<i>I assume you do not want community helping you with this project. 
</I>&gt;<i>Otherwise, you would announce that you are about to release a new beta, and 
</I>&gt;<i>what are your goals for that beta. People would then check your code and 
</I>&gt;<i>help you debug it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At least upload your source to the SVN, and hopefully  in a same matter, in 
</I>&gt;<i>small increments so we can understand what are you changing in the code.
</I>
You seem quite bitter elcuco... I apologize if I'm the one who make you feel 
that way but that's not the point right now. I did announce that I was about 
to release a new beta (at least it was my understanding of what I said...) 
and if I post it as a &quot;release file&quot; on Berlios that's only because it was 
the easiest and fastest way for me to give you the opportunity to check the 
code...
Uploading on the SVN would have been a bit longer and I was unsure about 
where to put it...
- Tools? I don't think of it as a tool but rather as a new base from which 
we would be able to write DevQt as a flexible IDE.
- Source? either it would have been unnoticed either I would have had to 
lcear the current trunk which I don't want..
- New folder? what name? and how to create them with SVN (I guess I'd need 
to read the docs ;-) )


&gt;<i>The toolbars keep location bewteen context changes, at least no my box. The 
</I>&gt;<i>flickers, I konw, I will see how can I take care of it. Not a high priority 
</I>&gt;<i>at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yep! The toolbars keep their posistion with your system and not with mine 
but the toolbars only allow actions with yours, no toolbarbreaks nor 
widgets... We've got to merge them to get something nice. I understand that 
you don't really care about the flicker right now but still, it's something 
to get rid of before a release candidate

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>- does it compiles on your PC ?
</I>&gt;<i>Yes.
</I>Nice ! As you have always had troubles with older versions I can't help but 
shouting my happiness to the world! :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>- does it runs fine on your PC ?
</I>&gt;<i>Yes. XP QT 4.1.1 MinGW 4.
</I>
Anyone tested it under Linux???
BTW I didn't know mingw 4.x.x had been released... When has that occured???

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>@Elcuco : I tested your plugin demo and there are interesting stuff but 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>you were right : the code is a mess !!!
</I>&gt;<i>Can you comment more briefly what &quot;is a mess&quot;? I understood that you 
</I>&gt;<i>modified the code, but the changes are lost in the complexity of the 
</I>&gt;<i>program. I just don't see them.
</I>
I don't take any code from the demos.The plugin configuration dialog seemed 
interesting but I didn't take the time to adapt it to my need. What is a 
mess ? Code is not very well commented, names are not self-explanative and 
lots of code appear to be commented (mostly in headers) without even a word 
to explain what their purpose were and why they were commented, plugins are 
hard-coded into the app, the code standars are unstable and sometimes not 
human-readable (especially for connect() stuff)...

&gt;<i>Can you describe how much flexible your code is? How is it done?
</I>&gt;<i>I don't want to be picky, but according to GPL (yes, my library is LGPL, 
</I>&gt;<i>but similar rules apply here) you are supposed to describe the changes to 
</I>&gt;<i>each file at the top. It's used to use some VCS to maintain those things. 
</I>&gt;<i>You are not doing any of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Quite frankly, I dont care about the license issue. But, if you want to 
</I>&gt;<i>make my life easier in helping you, please document the changes, and ask 
</I>&gt;<i>for new features. in qmdilib. I am thinking about new functionalities I 
</I>&gt;<i>want to add  to the lib, and if you don't talk, you will find your code 
</I>&gt;<i>going in another direction then mine. This is called a fork.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Quite frankly I didn't understood why you started creating a lib (that is 
not really a lib BTW) as a tool for DevQt and stated that is wasn't part of 
the project. I see the risk of fork but due to my poor internet connection 
and lack of time and also because I was only working on a beta, I didn't 
bothered you with my modifications.
I can understand that you want to keep qmdilib apart from the project but 
then you're bringing serious limitations to flexibility... In such a case 
I'd like you to continue working on it without committing on the SVN until 
you come to a working release that could be used without uncompatibility and 
license troubles. In the meantime DevQt would keep the modified verison of 
qmdilib that is currently used and wait for your work to end.
