&quot;the code standars are unstable and sometimes not human-readable 
(especially for connect() stuff)...&quot;

Can you comment about that? What part did you find that was the weakest 
on my code?

I noticed your point about widgets on toolbars, and I will address it soon.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite frankly I didn't understood why you started creating a lib (that 
</I>&gt;<i> is not really a lib BTW) as a tool for DevQt and stated that is wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the project. I see the risk of fork but due to my poor 
</I>&gt;<i> internet connection and lack of time and also because I was only 
</I>&gt;<i> working on a beta, I didn't bothered you with my modifications.
</I>And by this you are violating the license of the LGPL:

2.a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
Feel free to &quot;violate&quot; this. I don't mind, and and give permission to 
everyone to link this so called library statically to every project you 
want (as long as you have a valid Qt license for you needs of course).

2.b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
This one bothers me. If I want to improve my software, I need your help. 
You are just not helping me to make a better software.

*5.* A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the 
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or 
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, 
in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore 
falls outside the scope of this License.
Just to make this clear if you do not modify mt library at all, and just 
link to it (dynamically as I think LGPL states, or statically as I 
pointed already), you have basically no restrictions. IANAL, but I think 
I got this part correctly. I hope :)

*10.* Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License.
It seems you need to put the copy of the LGPL with the distributed 
source. Not a big problem, since in these days you can always search for 
it and find it in a minute on the web.

The deal, is that you cannot choose which rights to use or not, you just 
need to comply with them or use another library. Again, all I am asking 
is &quot;what did you change&quot;, nothing more.
&gt;<i> I can understand that you want to keep qmdilib apart from the project 
</I>&gt;<i> but then you're bringing serious limitations to flexibility... In such 
</I>&gt;<i> a case I'd like you to continue working on it without committing on 
</I>&gt;<i> the SVN until you come to a working release that could be used without 
</I>&gt;<i> uncompatibility and license troubles. In the meantime DevQt would keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the modified verison of qmdilib that is currently used and wait for 
</I>&gt;<i> your work to end.
</I>I will definetly not do such thing. I am comiting my work to the SVN so 
other people will be able to see what I am doing and help me improve my 
code. I only hope that my code is helpful to them, and they will use it. 
Taking the source from developers is the worst thing that a can be done 
for this kind of project.
