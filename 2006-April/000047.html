<PRE>&gt;<i>&quot;the code standars are unstable and sometimes not human-readable 
</I>&gt;<i>(especially for connect() stuff)...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Can you comment about that? What part did you find that was the weakest on 
</I>&gt;<i>my code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you don't mind I'll not do it right now, I'm rather busy ATM...

&gt;<i>I noticed your point about widgets on toolbars, and I will address it soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No need! I did it today!!! I went back to your version, thought a bit and 
solved the two most important problems : widgets (hopefully you used a QList 
of QObject* so it wasn't that hard) and flicker (just use a boolean to store 
modification state thus avoid to clear and unmodified toolbars. Bonus : 
toolbars still keep their locations between GUI updates. Bonus hint : to use 
toolbar breaks just call :

//toolbars stuff

updateGUI(this);
addToolBarBreak();

//other toolbars stuff

Within the mainwindow it achieve it though the code isn't the nicest ever...

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Quite frankly I didn't understood why you started creating a lib (that is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>not really a lib BTW) as a tool for DevQt and stated that is wasn't part 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of the project. I see the risk of fork but due to my poor internet 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>connection and lack of time and also because I was only working on a beta, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I didn't bothered you with my modifications.
</I>&gt;<i>And by this you are violating the license of the LGPL:
</I>
My understanding was that any Qt4-based piece of code written with the open 
source edition had to be licensed under GPL, other licensing requiring a 
commercial version of Qt4... What's wrong ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
</I>&gt;<i>Feel free to &quot;violate&quot; this. I don't mind, and and give permission to 
</I>&gt;<i>everyone to link this so called library statically to every project you 
</I>&gt;<i>want (as long as you have a valid Qt license for you needs of course).
</I>
Nice to you.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating 
</I>&gt;<i>that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</I>&gt;<i>This one bothers me. If I want to improve my software, I need your help. 
</I>&gt;<i>You are just not helping me to make a better software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Lack of time once again... I corrected that already. The next update of the 
beta (coming within 2 weeks because I'm gonna be on holidays, far away from 
my PC, for 5 days) will respect that clause.

&gt;<i>*5.* A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, 
</I>&gt;<i>but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with 
</I>&gt;<i>it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is 
</I>&gt;<i>not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope 
</I>&gt;<i>of this License.
</I>&gt;<i>Just to make this clear if you do not modify mt library at all, and just 
</I>&gt;<i>link to it (dynamically as I think LGPL states, or statically as I pointed 
</I>&gt;<i>already), you have basically no restrictions. IANAL, but I think I got this 
</I>&gt;<i>part correctly. I hope :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Don't see the point since I modified qmdilib...

&gt;<i>*10.* Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
</I>&gt;<i>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
</I>&gt;<i>licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to 
</I>&gt;<i>these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
</I>&gt;<i>the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
</I>&gt;<i>responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
</I>&gt;<i>It seems you need to put the copy of the LGPL with the distributed source. 
</I>&gt;<i>Not a big problem, since in these days you can always search for it and 
</I>&gt;<i>find it in a minute on the web.
</I>
Can be done I think...

I guess we're done with those licensing stuff so here is my plan :
- put the LGPL along with the archive I posted, and maybe state 
modifications in qmdilib if you really wish it
- rearchive them all
- create a &quot;base&quot; folder in the svn repository
- upload the modified archive there
- track as many bugs as you can (everyone is welcome to do that...) and tell 
me about them
- in a few weeks I'll upload an usable version of the new base, after 
testing it under win 9X/ME, win XP, various Linux distros and Mac OS X we'll 
bacup the current trunk and set the base as trunk
- then we'll be able to further the developpment of DevQt, especially the 
defaut plugin

This is just a short roadmap, please tell me if you agree or disagree.

Offtopic :
- a while ago you talked about putting on the svn a &quot;sphere&quot; stuff done with 
thiago, where is it???
- any news from the other members of the team or are we alone???
