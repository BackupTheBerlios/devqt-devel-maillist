<PRE>Oops, sorry. I have been confunded with another project of mine :)

FMC, can you test the zip file (not the trunk) I have posted a week ago?

Can you spend some time and try to find out where does the code crash?

Thago, as you seem to have no time to review it, can you forward it to
FMC? Thanks.

fix the crash (the clipboard got connected before it was happen, and
some slot was trying to be connected to NULL).

Does it inform you of changes outside the editor? (someone deleted the
file, or modified outside the editor).

&gt;<i>         - a project management still a little buggy but that crush any

</I>Qt4DS loaded a few projects of mine. Some even included sub directories.
It still kept the original structore of the project. DevQt does not.

BTW, the new code on the project manager did not crash for me. It seems
to be stable.

&gt;<i>         - a good settings handling
</I>How do I go back to the defaults? Many of the &quot;options&quot; on the GUI are
just GUI. Nothing behind it. What really frustrates me about the current
code is that we have no separation between functionality and GUI. We
need a clear separation between them. Not only for unit-testing, also
for portability. 

&gt;<i>         - a basic compiling engine including a basic console as well
</I>BTW, this is a bad idea. Because of the &quot;console support&quot; I managed to
stuck devqt several times. There are a lot of commands which are
interactive. We cannot filter them out, and we cannot handle them at all
(&quot;less devqt.pro&quot;, &quot;mc&quot;).

</I>&gt;<i>         BTW what does qhocr means???
</I><A HREF="http://iglu.org.il/~diego/qhocr">http://iglu.org.il/~diego/qhocr</A>
It's an OCR software for Hebrew written (partly) on Qt. I am about to
release a new version soon, hence the confusion. Sorry, my bad.


&gt;<i>         Looks like the berlios forum is abandonned but I don't care as
</I>&gt;<i>         long as we
</I>&gt;<i>         use the mailing list.
</I>We decided to use the ML no? I prefer the ML.

</I>&gt;<i>         it with a blue
</I>&gt;<i>         palette (tested under Kubuntu 5.10 and Win XP)
</I>The forums? or site? If it's the site, it will be changed this WE. We
cannot afford having a none working site.
